# DownGuiLighter

"DownGuiLighter" is an app that collects highlights that a user makes during the normal deploy of different E-book readers and that saves them in a compatible e-book file.
It also integrates a small HTML viewer were the user can consult and jump to the highlighted texts. For future uses and archival purposes, it saves the highlighted texts in a database where they are related to some meta-data about the book.
Downlighter is way of maintaining a permanent collection of the highlights of all the books read that is independent from any commercial vendors. It produces files the could be universally read due to the nature of the open-source files that it deploys. 
This  achieves very important goals. First it makes the user independent of the hazards of commercial software, bankruptcy, abandonment of the project or changes in the policies of companies, to name some. Secondly empowers the management of the personal data aquired by the user letting him jump from one reading app to the other without having to be preoccupied with the loss of data.
The app could be a very important tool used for archival and research purposes.
